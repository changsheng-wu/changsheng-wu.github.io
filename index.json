These same technologies can also be used in the home, across a broad spectrum of ages, from beginning to end of life. Although miniaturized forms of such devices minimize patient burden and improve compliance, they represent life-threatening choking hazards for infants. A materials strategy is presented here to address this concern. Specifically, composite materials are introduced as soft encapsulating layers and gentle adhesives that release chemical compounds designed to elicit an intense bitter taste when placed in the mouth. Reflexive reactions to this sensation strongly reduce the potential for ingestion, as a safety feature. The materials systems described involve a non-toxic bitterant (denatonium benzoate) as a dopant in an elastomeric (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) or hydrogel matrix. Experimental and computational studies of these composite materials and the kinetics of release of the bitterant define the key properties. Incorporation into various wireless skin-integrated sensors demonstrates their utility in functional systems. This simple strategy offers valuable protective capabilities, with broad practical relevance to the welfare of children monitored with wearable devices.","tags":["wearable electronics","adhesive","bioelectronics"],"title":"Bitter Flavored, Soft Composites for Wearables Designed to Reduce Risks of Choking in Infants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haiwen Luan","Qihui Zhang","Tzu-Li Liu","Xueju Wang","Shiwei Zhao","Heling Wang","Shenglian Yao","Yeguang Xue","Jean Won Kwak","Wubin Bai","Yameng Xu","Mengdi Han","Kan Li","Zhengwei Li","Xinchen Ni","Jilong Ye","Dongwhi Choi","Quansan Yang","Jae-Hwan Kim","Shuo Li","Shulin Chen","Changsheng Wu","Di Lu","Jan-Kai Chang","Zhaoqian Xie","Yonggang Huang","John A.

A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) made with two radial-cut wood samples (L x R x T: 35 x 20 x 1 mm(3)), respectively functionalized with ZIF-8 and PDMS, can generate an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 24.3 V and a short-circuit current (Isc) of 0.32 mu A upon 50 N, 80 times higher compared with that of native wood.

Soft, skin-mounted electronics that incorporate high-bandwidth, miniaturized motion sensors enable digital, wireless measurements of mechanoacoustic (MA) signatures of both core vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) and underexplored biomarkers (coughing count) with high fidelity and immunity to ambient noises. This paper summarizes an effort that integrates such MA sensors with a cloud data infrastructure and a set of analytics approaches based on digital filtering and convolutional neural networks for monitoring of COVID-19 infections in sick and healthy individuals in the hospital and the home. Unique features are in quantitative measurements of coughing and other vocal events, as indicators of both disease and infectiousness. Systematic imaging studies demonstrate correlations between the time and intensity of coughing, speaking, and laughing and the total droplet production, as an approximate indicator of the probability for disease spread. The sensors, deployed on COVID-19 patients along with healthy controls in both inpatient and home settings, record coughing frequency and intensity continuously, along with a collection of other biometrics. The results indicate a decaying trend of coughing frequency and intensity through the course of disease recovery, but with wide variations across patient populations. The methodology creates opportunities to study patterns in biometrics across individuals and among different demographic groups.","tags":["wearable electronics","digital health","artificial intelligence","COVID-19"],"title":"Automated, multiparametric monitoring of respiratory biomarkers and vital signs in clinical and home settings for COVID-19 patients","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyoyoung Jeong","Jong Yoon Lee","KunHyuck Lee","Youn J.

However, because of limited availability, many sample types are still difficult to study by metabolomic analyses. Here, we present a mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics strategy that only consumes sub-nanoliter sample volumes. The approach consists of combining a customized metabolomics workflow with a pulsed MS ion generation method, known as triboelectric nanogenerator inductive nanoelectrospray ionization (TENGi nanoESI) MS. Samples tested with this approach include exhaled breath condensate collected from cystic fibrosis patients as well as in vitro-cultured human mesenchymal stromal cells. Both test samples are only available in minimum amounts. Experiments show that picoliter-volume spray pulses suffice to generate high-quality spectral fingerprints, which increase the information density produced per unit sample volume. This TENGi nanoESI strategy has the potential to fill in the gap in metabolomics where liquid chromatography-MS-based analyses cannot be applied. Our method opens up avenues for future investigations into understanding metabolic changes caused by diseases or external stimuli. The analysis of metabolites offers promises in biomarker discovery. Here the authors demonstrate the metabolomics analysis of sub-nanoliter samples using triboelectric nanogenerator inductive nanoelectrospray ionization, which they apply to exhaled breath condensate from cystic fibrosis patients and mesenchymal stromal cells.","tags":["triboelectric nanogenerator","mass spectrometry"],"title":"Sub-nanoliter metabolomics via mass spectrometry to characterize volume-limited samples","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jianguo Sun","Hengyu Guo","Javier Ribera","Changsheng Wu","Kunkun Tu","Marco Binelli","Guido Panzarasa","Francis W.

Many of the most widely used piezoelectric materials, including lead zirconate titanate (PZT), suffer from serious drawbacks such as complicated synthesis, poor mechanical properties (e.g., brittleness), and toxic composition, limiting their development for biomedical applications and posing environmental problems for their disposal. Here, we report a low-cost, biodegradable, biocompatible, and highly compressible piezoelectric nanogenerator based on a wood sponge obtained with a simple delignification process. Thanks to the enhanced compressibility of the wood sponge, our wood nanogenerator (15 x 15 x 14 mm(3), longitudinal x radial x tangential) can generate an output voltage of up to 0.69 V, 85 times higher than that generated by native (untreated) wood, and it shows stable performance under repeated cyclic compression (= 600 cycles). Our approach suggests the importance of increased compressibility of bulk materials for improving their piezoelectric output. We demonstrate the versatility of our nanogenerator by showing its application both as a wearable movement monitoring system (made with a single wood sponge) and as a large-scale prototype with increased output (made with 30 wood sponges) able to power simple electronic devices (a LED light, a LCD screen). Moreover, we demonstrate the biodegradability of our wood sponge piezoelectric nanogenerator by studying its decomposition with cellulose-degrading fungi. Our results showcase the potential application of a wood sponge as a sustainable energy source, as a wearable device for monitoring human motions, and its contribution to environmental sustainability by electronic waste reduction.","tags":["piezoelectric nanogenerator","wood","energy harvesting"],"title":"Sustainable and Biodegradable Wood Sponge Piezoelectric Nanogenerator for Sensing and Energy Harvesting Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marcos Bouza","Yafeng Li","Changsheng Wu","Hengyu Guo","Zhong L.

A short time span, sunlight-triggered degradable TENG is developed. The main substrate includes an acid-sensitive poly(phthalaldehyde) (PPHA), a photoacid generator (PAG), and a photosensitizer (PS). Through photo-induced electron transfer, the ultraviolet radiation absorbed by the PS is transferred to the PAG to generate photoacids that trigger the depolymerization of PPHA. Transient TENG-based mechanical energy harvesters and touch/acoustic sensors are successfully demonstrated by embedding silver nanowires onto the PPHA-based films. The fabricated devices degrade rapidly under winter sunlight. The degradation rate can be further tuned via changing the ratio of photosensitive agents. This work not only broadens the applicability of TENG as transient power sources and sensors, but also extends the use of transient functional polymers toward advanced energy and sensing applications.","tags":["triboelectric nanogenerator","transient electronics","energy harvesting"],"title":"Sunlight-Triggerable Transient Energy Harvester and Sensors Based on Triboelectric Nanogenerator Using Acid-Sensitive Poly(phthalaldehyde)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peng Jiang","Lei Zhang","Hengyu Guo","Chaoyu Chen","Changsheng Wu","Steven Zhang","Zhong Lin Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"a0e15bf2fbf23a240a964722c9a430ae","permalink":"/publication/wos-000481227300001/","publishdate":"2021-12-20T22:13:46.035036Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000481227300001/","section":"publication","summary":"A liquid-solid contact triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) film, a copper electrode, and a glass substrate for harvesting energy in oil/water multiphases is reported.

A 2D ferroelectric semiconductor coupled with the piezo-phototronic effect may bring unprecedented functional characteristics. Here, a heterojunction photodetector made of p-Si/V-doped-ferroelectric-ZnO 2D nanosheets (FESZ-PD) is fabricated, and the ferroelectricity-enhanced piezo-phototronic effect on the photoresponse behavior of the FESZ-PD is carefully investigated. By introducing the ferroelectricity and the piezo-phototronic effect, improved current rectification performance is achieved and the photoresponse performance of the heterojunction is enhanced in a broad spectral range. The applied voltage bias during measurement naturally causes ferroelectric spontaneous polarizations to align, resulting in a change in band structure near the interface and the local piezo-phototronic effect. The modulated energy band promotes the generation, separation, and transportation efficiency of photogenerated carriers greatly. Compared with the Si/ZnO 2D nanosheets photodetector without ferroelectricity under strain-free conditions, the photoresponsivity R of the FESZ-PD increases by 2.4 times when applying a -0.20 parts per thousand compressive strain at +1 V forward bias. These results confirm the feasibility of coupling the ferroelectricity with the piezo-phototronic effect in 2D ferroelectric materials to enhance the photoresponse behavior, which provides a good way to enable the development of high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.","tags":["piezo-phototronic"],"title":"Ferroelectricity-Enhanced Piezo-Phototronic Effect in 2D V-Doped ZnO Nanosheets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenbo Ding","Jianfeng Zhou","Jia Cheng","Zhaozheng Wang","Hengyu Guo","Changsheng Wu","Sixing Xu","Zhiyi Wu","Xing Xie","Zhong Lin Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561939200,"objectID":"35747985950d4ca9091763133ef13cd2","permalink":"/publication/wos-000477779600013/","publishdate":"2021-12-20T22:13:46.03714Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000477779600013/","section":"publication","summary":"Water disinfection at the point of use (POU) has enormous social and economic significance, especially for rural areas or catastrophes.

The MFMS consists of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) module, a magnetic regulation module, and an acrylic shell.

The carefully designed six copper electrodes (an inner circle electrode, an outer circle electrode, and four arc electrodes between them) can distinguish eight directions of movement with the acceleration and determine the rotational speed and direction as well. Besides, the magnetic regulation module is applied here by fixing a magnetic cylinder (MC) in the shell, right under the center of the PTFE plate. Due to the magnetic attraction applied by the MC, the MD will automatically return to the center to prepare for the next round of detection, which makes the proposed sensor much more applicable in practice.","tags":["acceleromater","triboelectric nanogenerator","self-powered","energy harvesting"],"title":"Self-Powered Multifunctional Motion Sensor a, Enabled by Magnetic-Regulated Triboelectric Nanogenerator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haiwu Zheng","Yunlong Zi","Xu He","Hengyu Guo","Ying-Chih Lai","Jie Wang","Steven L.

Self-powered sensors that can perceive and respond to environmental stimuli without an external power supply are highly desirable. In this paper, a self-powered wind sensor system based on an anemometer triboelectric nanogenerator (a-TENG, free-standing mode) and a wind vane triboelectric nanogenerator (v-TENG, single-electrode mode) is proposed for simultaneously detecting wind speed and direction. A soft friction mode is adopted instead of a typical rigid friction for largely enhancing the output performance of the TENG. The design parameters including size, unit central angle, and applied materials are optimized to enhance sensitivity, resolution, and wide measurement scale. The optimized a-TENG could deliver an open-circuit voltage of 88 V and short-circuit current of 6.3 mu A, corresponding to a maximum power output of 0.47 mW (wind speed of 6.0 m/s), which is capable of driving electronics for data transmission and storage. The current peak value of the a-TENG signal is used for analyzing wind speed for less energy consumption. Moreover, the output characteristics of a v-TENG are further explored, with six actual operation situations, and the v-TENG delivers fast response to the incoming wind and accurately outputs the wind direction data. As a wind sensor system, wind speed ranging from 2.7 to 8.0 m/s can be well detected (consistent with a commercial sensor) and eight regular directions can be monitored. Therefore, the fabricated wind sensor system has great potential in wireless environmental monitoring applications.","tags":["triboelectric nanogenerator","energy harvesting","self-powered"],"title":"Self-Powered Wind Sensor System for Detecting Wind Speed and Direction Based on a Triboelectric Nanogenerator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qiu Jiang","Changsheng Wu","Zhengjun Wang","Aurelia Chi Wang","Jr-Hau He","Zhong Lin Wang","Husam N.

This work serves as an important progress for the future development and standardization of TENG, especially for harvesting lowfrequency vibration energy as well as a great prospect of blue energy.","tags":["triboelectric nanogenerator","energy harvesting","blue energy"],"title":"A spring-based resonance coupling for hugely enhancing the performance of triboelectric nanogenerators for harvesting low-frequency vibration energy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xu He","Yunlong Zi","Hengyu Guo","Haiwu Zheng","Yi Xi","Changsheng Wu","Jie Wang","Wei Zhang","Canhui Lu","Zhong Lin Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"ad2299d6d434c5fd08d49717c37d3495","permalink":"/publication/wos-000394671200015/","publishdate":"2021-12-20T22:13:46.044491Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000394671200015/","section":"publication","summary":"The development of flexible and stretchable electronics has attracted intensive attention for their promising applications in next-generation wearable functional devices.

Herein, a novel type of highly stretchable, fiber-based triboelectric nanogenerator (fiber-like TENG) for power generation is developed. Owing to the advanced structural designs, including the fiber-convolving fiber and the stretchable electrodes on elastic silicone rubber fiber, the fiber-like TENG can be operated at stretching mode with high strains up to 70% and is demonstrated for a broad range of applications such as powering a commercial capacitor, LCD screen, digital watch/calculator, and self-powered acceleration sensor. This work verifies the promising potential of a novel fiber-based structure for both power generation and self-powered sensing.","tags":["triboelectric nanogenerator","self-powered","wearable electronics"],"title":"A Highly Stretchable Fiber-Based Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Self-Powered Wearable Electronics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ying-Chih Lai","Jianan Deng","Simiao Niu","Wenbo Peng","Changsheng Wu","Ruiyuan Liu","Zhen Wen","Zhong Lin Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480550400,"objectID":"47c8f4703e178396594853277fbbbfa6","permalink":"/publication/wos-000392725200014/","publishdate":"2021-12-20T22:13:46.044714Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000392725200014/","section":"publication","summary":"Electric eel-skin-inspired mechanically durable and super-stretchable nanogenerator is demonstrated for the first time by using triboelectric effect.

Here, we present a prototype of an all-in-one shape-adaptive self-charging power unit that can be used for scavenging random body motion energy under complex mechanical deformations and then directly storing it in a supercapacitor unit to build up a self-powered system for wearable electronics. A kirigami paper based supercapacitor (KP-SC) was designed to work as the flexible energy storage device (stretchability up to 215%). An ultrastretchable and shape-adaptive silicone rubber triboelectric nanogenerator (SR-TENG) was utilized as the flexible energy harvesting device. By combining them with a rectifier, a stretchable, twistable, and bendable, self-charging power package was achieved for sustainably driving wearable electronics.

Mechanical properties of soft tissues can merely be mimicked at small strain situations, such as ultrasonic induced vibration. Under large deformation, the soft tissues and the 3D printed phantoms behave differently. The essential barrier is the inherent difference in the stress-strain curves of soft tissues and 3D printable polymers. This study investigated the feasibility of mimicking the strain-stiffening behavior of soft tissues using dual-material 3D printed metamaterials with micro-structured reinforcement embedded in soft polymeric matrix. Three types of metamaterials were designed and tested: sinusoidal wave, double helix, and interlocking chains. Even though the two base materials were strain-softening polymers, both finite element analysis and uniaxial tension tests indicated that two of those dual-material designs were able to exhibit strain-stiffening effects as a metamaterial. The effects of the design parameters on the mechanical behavior of the metamaterials were also demonstrated. The results suggested that the fabrication of patient-specific tissue-mimicking phantoms with both geometrical and mechanical accuracies is possible with dual-material 3D printed metamaterials.

In this work, a self-powered electrochemical synthesis circle is designed, in which the electrode material of the TENG, polypyrrole (PPy), is prepared by the pulse output of the PPy-based TENG itself. The TENG based on PPy from self-powered synthesis (SPSPPy) presents a competitive performance compared to those made from commercial pulse sources. A supercapacitor that is fabricated from SPSPPy has a far superior performance than that synthesized by the conventional galvanostatic method. Furthermore, a self-charging power system that integrates a TENG and a supercapacitor is demonstrated to drive an electronic device sustainably. Moreover, the polymerization efficiency is optimized in TENG-based electrochemical synthesis because its high voltage can sustain multiple reactors simultaneously. Its upper limit is theoretically analyzed for optimal energy utility, and a maximum number of 39 reactors can be powered experimentally. Hence, TENG is validated as an effective pulse generator for the synthesis of PPy as well as other electrochemical technology, and this work greatly improves the understandings of TENG-based self-powered electrochemical systems.","tags":["energy harvesting","triboelectric nanogenerator","self-powered"],"title":"Self-Powered Electrochemical Synthesis of Polypyrrole from the Pulsed Output of a Triboelectric Nanogenerator as a Sustainable Energy System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Changsheng Wu","Xin Wang","Long Lin","Hengyu Guo","Zhong Lin Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1459468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1459468800,"objectID":"9f42d7176ca960c728345aded91b8c51","permalink":"/publication/wos-000375245000088/","publishdate":"2021-12-20T22:13:46.045854Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wos-000375245000088/","section":"publication","summary":"The development of stretchable energy generation devices is indispensable for achieving stretchable, self-powered electronic systems.

However, this integration is challenging because: (1) most 3D printing techniques leave rough or porous surfaces if they are untreated; (2) the thermal sintering process required for most conductive inks could degrade the polymeric materials of 3D printed parts; and (3) the extensive pause needed for the DW process during layer-by-layer fabrication may cause weaker interlayer bonding and create structural weak points. These challenges are rather common during the insertion of conductive patterns inside 3D printed structures. As an avoidance tactic, we developed a simple `print-stick-peel' method to transfer the DW device from the polytetrafluoroethylene or perfluoroalkoxy alkanes film onto any layer of a 3D printed object. This transfer can be achieved using the self-adhesion of 3D printing materials or applying additional adhesive. We demonstrated this method by transferring Aerosol Jet (R) printed strain sensors into parts fabricated by PolyJet (TM) printing. This report provides an investigation and discussion on the sensitivity, reliability, and influence embedding the sensor has on mechanical properties.","tags":["advanced manufacturing"],"title":"A facile method for integrating direct-write devices into three-dimensional printed parts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siyu Guo","Changsheng Wu","Manuel Danner","Andre Nobre","Armin G.
