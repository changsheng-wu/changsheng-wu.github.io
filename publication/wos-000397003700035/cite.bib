 abstract = {Low-frequency vibration is a ubiquitous energy that exists almost
everywhere, but a high efficient harvesting of which remains
challenging. Recently developed triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)
provides a promising alternative approach to conventional
electromagnetic and piezoelectric generators, with the advantage of low
cost and high output voltage. In this work, a mechanical spring-based
amplifier with the ability of amplifying both the vibration frequency
and amplitude is integrated with TENG to improve its low-frequency
performance by up to 10 times. A new scheme for evaluating TENG using
the average output power is proposed and the process of choosing an
appropriate time interval for analysis is demonstrated. It takes into
account the temporal variation in electrical output and offers a more
accurate and convincing evaluation of TENG's performance in practical
working environment compared to previously used instantaneous power.
This work serves as an important progress for the future development and
standardization of TENG, especially for harvesting lowfrequency
vibration energy as well as a great prospect of blue energy.},
