 abstract = {Harvesting energy available from ambient environment is highly desirable
for powering personal electronics and health applications. Due to
natural process and human activities, steam can be produced by boilers,
human perspiration, and the wind exists ubiquitously. In the outdoor
environment, these two phenomena usually exist at the same place, which
contain heat and mechanical energies simultaneously. However, previous
studies have isolated them as separate sources of energy to harvest and
hence failed to utilize them effectively. Herein, we present unique
hybrid nanogenerators for individually/simultaneously harvesting thermal
energy from water vapors and mechanical energy from intermittent wind
blowing from the bottom side, which consist of a wind-driven
triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and pyroelectric piezoelectric
nanogenerators (PPENGs). The output power of the PPENG and the TENG can
be up to about 184.32 mu W and 4.74 mW, respectively, indicating the
TENG plays the dominant role. Our hybrid nanogenerators could provide
different applications such as to power digital watch and enable
self-powered sensing with wireless transmission. The device could also
be further integrated into a face mask for potentially wearable
applications. This work not only provides a promising approach for
renewable energy harvesting but also enriches potential applications for
self -powered systems and wireless sensors.},
