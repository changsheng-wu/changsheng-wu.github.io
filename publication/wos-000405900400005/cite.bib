 abstract = {With its light weight, low cost and high efficiency even at low
operation frequency, the triboelectric nanogenerator is considered a
potential solution for self-powered sensor networks and large-scale
renewable blue energy. As an energy harvester, its output power density
and efficiency are dictated by the triboelectric charge density. Here we
report a method for increasing the triboelectric charge density by
coupling surface polarization from triboelectrification and hysteretic
dielectric polarization from ferroelectric material in vacuum (P similar
to 10(-6) torr). Without the constraint of air breakdown, a
triboelectric charge density of 1003 mu C m(-2), which is close to the
limit of dielectric breakdown, is attained. Our findings establish an
optimization methodology for triboelectric nanogenerators and enable
their more promising usage in applications ranging from powering
electronic devices to harvesting large-scale blue energy.},
