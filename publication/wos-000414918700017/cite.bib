 abstract = {An integrated self-powered dynamic displacement monitoring system by
utilizing a novel triboelectric accelerometer for structural health
monitoring is proposed and implemented in this study, which can show the
dynamic displacement and transmit the alarming signal by accurately
sensing the vibration acceleration. The fabricated triboelectric
accelerometer based on the noncontact freestanding triboelectric
nanogenerator consists of an outer transparent sleeve tube and an inner
cylindrical inertial mass that is suspended by a highly stretchable
silicone fiber. One pair of copper film electrodes is deposited by
physical vapor deposition on nylon film and adhered on the inner wall of
the outer tube, while a fluorinated ethylene propylene film with
nanowire structures is adhered on the surface of the inner cylindrical
inertial mass. The experimental results show that proposed triboelectric
accelerometer can accurately sense the vibration acceleration with a
high sensitivity of 0.391 V s2 m(-1). In particular, the developed
accelerometer has superior performance within the low-frequency range.
One of the most striking features is that the commercial accelerometer
using piezoelectric material is strongly dominated by high-order
harmonics, which can cause confusion in computer data analysis. In
contrast, the triboelectric accelerometer is only dominated by the base
resonance mode.},
