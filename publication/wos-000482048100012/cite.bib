 abstract = {Emerging 2D electronic materials have shown great potential for
regulating and controlling optoelectronic processes. A 2D ferroelectric
semiconductor coupled with the piezo-phototronic effect may bring
unprecedented functional characteristics. Here, a heterojunction
photodetector made of p-Si/V-doped-ferroelectric-ZnO 2D nanosheets
(FESZ-PD) is fabricated, and the ferroelectricity-enhanced
piezo-phototronic effect on the photoresponse behavior of the FESZ-PD is
carefully investigated. By introducing the ferroelectricity and the
piezo-phototronic effect, improved current rectification performance is
achieved and the photoresponse performance of the heterojunction is
enhanced in a broad spectral range. The applied voltage bias during
measurement naturally causes ferroelectric spontaneous polarizations to
align, resulting in a change in band structure near the interface and
the local piezo-phototronic effect. The modulated energy band promotes
the generation, separation, and transportation efficiency of
photogenerated carriers greatly. Compared with the Si/ZnO 2D nanosheets
photodetector without ferroelectricity under strain-free conditions, the
photoresponsivity R of the FESZ-PD increases by 2.4 times when applying
a -0.20 parts per thousand compressive strain at +1 V forward bias.
These results confirm the feasibility of coupling the ferroelectricity
with the piezo-phototronic effect in 2D ferroelectric materials to
enhance the photoresponse behavior, which provides a good way to enable
the development of high-performance electronic and optoelectronic
devices.},
