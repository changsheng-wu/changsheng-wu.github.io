 abstract = {Capabilities in continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters of
disease have never been more important than in the context of the global
COVID-19 pandemic. Soft, skin-mounted electronics that incorporate
high-bandwidth, miniaturized motion sensors enable digital, wireless
measurements of mechanoacoustic (MA) signatures of both core vital signs
(heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) and underexplored
biomarkers (coughing count) with high fidelity and immunity to ambient
noises. This paper summarizes an effort that integrates such MA sensors
with a cloud data infrastructure and a set of analytics approaches based
on digital filtering and convolutional neural networks for monitoring of
COVID-19 infections in sick and healthy individuals in the hospital and
the home. Unique features are in quantitative measurements of coughing
and other vocal events, as indicators of both disease and
infectiousness. Systematic imaging studies demonstrate correlations
between the time and intensity of coughing, speaking, and laughing and
the total droplet production, as an approximate indicator of the
probability for disease spread. The sensors, deployed on COVID-19
patients along with healthy controls in both inpatient and home
settings, record coughing frequency and intensity continuously, along
with a collection of other biometrics. The results indicate a decaying
trend of coughing frequency and intensity through the course of disease
recovery, but with wide variations across patient populations. The
methodology creates opportunities to study patterns in biometrics across
individuals and among different demographic groups.},
