 abstract = {In this work, the operation of a standalone streetlamp PV system is
modeled considering actual outdoor operation conditions. The model
integrates all components required in a stand-alone PV system: PV panel,
battery, charge controller and load. Electrical characteristics of each
component are based on those of a streetlamp PV system, currently tested
in Singapore. Using measured irradiance data, the model is able to
predict the real-time current flow, battery operating voltage and state
of charge. The simulations of the streetlamp system are done using
real-measured irradiance data from Singapore and Boston. We find that
for a long-term, uninterrupted operation of a standalone PV system
actual meteorological conditions need to be considered. The real-time
simulation method presented in this work allows better defining the size
of the required solar panel and the battery capacity.},
