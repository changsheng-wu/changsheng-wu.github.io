 abstract = {The human metabolome provides a window into the mechanisms and
biomarkers of various diseases. However, because of limited
availability, many sample types are still difficult to study by
metabolomic analyses. Here, we present a mass spectrometry (MS)-based
metabolomics strategy that only consumes sub-nanoliter sample volumes.
The approach consists of combining a customized metabolomics workflow
with a pulsed MS ion generation method, known as triboelectric
nanogenerator inductive nanoelectrospray ionization (TENGi nanoESI) MS.
Samples tested with this approach include exhaled breath condensate
collected from cystic fibrosis patients as well as in vitro-cultured
human mesenchymal stromal cells. Both test samples are only available in
minimum amounts. Experiments show that picoliter-volume spray pulses
suffice to generate high-quality spectral fingerprints, which increase
the information density produced per unit sample volume. This TENGi
nanoESI strategy has the potential to fill in the gap in metabolomics
where liquid chromatography-MS-based analyses cannot be applied. Our
method opens up avenues for future investigations into understanding
metabolic changes caused by diseases or external stimuli. The analysis
of metabolites offers promises in biomarker discovery. Here the authors
demonstrate the metabolomics analysis of sub-nanoliter samples using
triboelectric nanogenerator inductive nanoelectrospray ionization, which
they apply to exhaled breath condensate from cystic fibrosis patients
and mesenchymal stromal cells.},
