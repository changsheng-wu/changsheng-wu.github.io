 abstract = {Water disinfection at the point of use (POU) has enormous social and
economic significance, especially for rural areas or catastrophes. To
tackle the requirements of power independence and cost control in such
applications, the concept of TriboPump is proposed, which is a low-cost,
hand-powered water disinfection system. The system consists of three
functional parts: a tubular coaxial-electrode copper ionization cell
(CECIC) as the disinfection device, a disk triboelectric nanogenerator
(D-TENG) as the power source, and a coaxial mechanical structure
including the water pump. The adoption of D-TENG can make the system
adaptive to varying system resistances without additional power
management circuits. Moreover, the integration of CECIC and TENG can
successfully turn their intrinsic limitations into advantages and a
synergic effect is achieved. With the integrated design, the system can
effectively disinfect the water while pumping it solely by hand power.
The cost estimate of the whole system can be as low as \$10 for a 2-year
service. It is believed that the whole system design provides a feasible
one-stop and cost-efficient solution for POU water pumping and
disinfection, which will ideally be suitable the rural areas or
sudden-onset catastrophes.},
