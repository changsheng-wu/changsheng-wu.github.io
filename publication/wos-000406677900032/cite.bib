 abstract = {Silicon underpins nearly all microelectronics today and will continue to
do so for some decades to come. However, for silicon photonics, the
indirect band gap of silicon and lack of adjustability severely limit
its use in applications such as broadband photodiodes. Here, a
high-performance p-Si/n-ZnO broadband photodiode working in a wide
wavelength range from visible to near-infrared light with high
sensitivity, fast response, and good stability is reported. The
absorption of near-infrared wavelength light is significantly enhanced
due to the nanostructured/textured top surface. The general performance
of the broadband photodiodes can be further improved by the
piezophototronic effect. The enhancement of responsivity can reach a
maximum of 78% to 442 nm illumination, the linearity and saturation
limit to 1060 nm light are also significantly increased by applying
external strains. The photodiode is illuminated with different
wavelength lights to selectively choose the photogenerated charge
carriers (either electrons or holes) passing through the depletion
region, to investigate the piezo-phototronic effect on electron or hole
transport separately for the first time. This is essential for studying
the basic principles in order to develop a full understanding about
piezotronics and it also enables the development of the better
performance of optoelectronics.},
