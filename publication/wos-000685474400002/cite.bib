Title = {{A Wireless Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Device for Flap Monitoring: Proof
   of Concept in a Porcine Musculocutaneous Flap Model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RECONSTRUCTIVE MICROSURGERY}},
Abstract = {{Background Current near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based systems for
   continuous flap monitoring are highly sensitive for detecting
   malperfusion. However, the clinical utility and user experience are
   limited by the wired connection between the sensor and bedside console.
   This wire leads to instability of the flap-sensor interface and may
   cause false alarms.
   Methods We present a novel wearable wireless NIRS sensor for continuous
   fasciocutaneous free flap monitoring. This waterproof
   silicone-encapsulated Bluetooth-enabled device contains two
   light-emitting diodes and two photodetectors in addition to a battery
   sufficient for 5 days of uninterrupted function. This novel device was
   compared with a ViOptix T.Ox monitor in a porcine rectus abdominus
   myocutaneous flap model of arterial and venous occlusions.
   Results Devices were tested in four flaps using three animals. Both
   devices produced very similar tissue oxygen saturation (StO (2) )
   tracings throughout the vascular clamping events, with obvious and
   parallel changes occurring on arterial clamping, arterial release,
   venous clamping, and venous release. Small interdevice variations in
   absolute StO (2) value readings and magnitude of change were observed.
   The normalized cross-correlation at zero lag describing correspondence
   between the novel NIRS and T.Ox devices was >0.99 in each trial.
   Conclusion The wireless NIRS flap monitor is capable of detecting StO
   (2) changes resultant from arterial vascular occlusive events. In this
   porcine flap model, the functionality of this novel sensor closely
   mirrored that of the T.Ox wired platform. This device is waterproof,
   highly adhesive, skin conforming, and has sufficient battery life to
   function for 5 days. Clinical testing is necessary to determine if this
   wireless functionality translates into fewer false-positive alarms and a
   better user experience.}},
