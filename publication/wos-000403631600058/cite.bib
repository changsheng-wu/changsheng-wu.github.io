 abstract = {Achievement of p-n homojuncted GaN enables the birth of III-nitride
light emitters. Owing to the wurtzite-structure of GaN, piezoelectric
polarization charges present at the interface can effectively
control/tune the optoelectric behaviors of local charge-carriers (i.e.,
the pitzo-phototropic effect). Here, we demonstrate the significantly
enhanced light-output efficiency and suppressed efficiency droop in GaN
microwire (MW)-based p n junction ultraviolet light-emitting diode (UV
LED) by the piezo-phototronic effect. By applying a 0.12% static
compressive strain perpendicular to the p n junction interface, the
relative external quantum efficiency of the LED is enhanced by over
600%. Furtherinore, efficiency droop is markedly reduced from 46.6% to
7.5% and corresponding droop onset current density shifts from 10 to
26.7 A cm72. Enhanced electrons confinement and improVed holes injection
efficiency by the piezo-photottonic effect are revealed and
theoretically Confirmed as the physical mechanisms. This study offers an
unconventional path to develop high efficiency, strong brightness and
`high power III-nitride light sources.},
