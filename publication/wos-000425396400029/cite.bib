 abstract = {The development of miniaturized, wearable, and implantable electronics
has increased the demand for small stand-alone power modules that have
steady output and long life-time. Given the limited capacity of energy
storage devices, one promising solution is to integrate energy
harvesting and storage materials to efficiently convert ambient
mechanical energy to electricity for direct use or to store the
harvested energy by electrochemical means. Here, a highly compact
self-charging power unit is proposed by integrating triboelectric
nanogenerator with MXene-based microsupercapacitors in a wearable and
flexible harvester-storage module. The device can utilize and store the
random energy from human activities in a standby mode and provide power
to electronics when active. As a result, our microsupercapacitor
delivers a capacitance of 23 mF/cm(2) with 95% capacitance retention
after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles, while the triboelectric
nanogenerator exhibits a maximum output power of 7.8 mu W/cm(2). Given
the simplicity and compact nature, our device can be integrated with a
variety of electronic devices and sensors.},
