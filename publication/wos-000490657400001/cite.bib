Abstract = {{Transient electronics that disintegrate via material dissolution or
   depolymerization under certain stimuli have great potential in
   biomedical and military applications. The triboelectric nanogenerator
   (TENG), an emerging mechanical energy harvesting technology with great
   flexibility in material choices, is promising in offering transient
   power sources. Previously reported transient energy harvesters using
   biodegradable polymers require solution-based degradation and have
   limited applications in non-biological scenarios. A short time span,
   sunlight-triggered degradable TENG is developed. The main substrate
   includes an acid-sensitive poly(phthalaldehyde) (PPHA), a photoacid
   generator (PAG), and a photosensitizer (PS). Through photo-induced
   electron transfer, the ultraviolet radiation absorbed by the PS is
   transferred to the PAG to generate photoacids that trigger the
   depolymerization of PPHA. Transient TENG-based mechanical energy
   harvesters and touch/acoustic sensors are successfully demonstrated by
   embedding silver nanowires onto the PPHA-based films. The fabricated
   devices degrade rapidly under winter sunlight. The degradation rate can
   be further tuned via changing the ratio of photosensitive agents. This
   work not only broadens the applicability of TENG as transient power
   sources and sensors, but also extends the use of transient functional
   polymers toward advanced energy and sensing applications.}},
