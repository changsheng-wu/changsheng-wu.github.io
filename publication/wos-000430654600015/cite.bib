 abstract = {Cyber security has become a serious concern as the internet penetrates
every corner of our life over the last two decades. The rapidly
developing human-machine interfacing calls for an effective and
continuous authentication solution. Herein, we developed a two-factor,
pressure-enhanced keystroke-dynamics-based security system that is
capable of authenticating and even identifying users through their
unique typing behavior. The system consists of a rationally designed
triboelectric keystroke device that converts typing motions into analog
electrical signals, and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm-based
software platform for user classification. This unconventional keystroke
device is self-powered, stretchable and water/dust proof, which makes it
highly mobile and applicable to versatile working environments. The
promising application of this novel system in the financial and
computing industry can push cyber security to the next level, where
leaked passwords would possibly be of no concern.},
