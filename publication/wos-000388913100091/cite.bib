 abstract = {Recently, a self-charging power unit consisting of an energy harvesting
device and an energy storage device set the foundation for building a
self-powered wearable system. However, the flexibility of the power unit
working under extremely complex deformations (e.g., stretching,
twisting, and bending) becomes a key issue. Here, we present a prototype
of an all-in-one shape-adaptive self-charging power unit that can be
used for scavenging random body motion energy under complex mechanical
deformations and then directly storing it in a supercapacitor unit to
build up a self-powered system for wearable electronics. A kirigami
paper based supercapacitor (KP-SC) was designed to work as the flexible
energy storage device (stretchability up to 215%). An ultrastretchable
and shape-adaptive silicone rubber triboelectric nanogenerator (SR-TENG)
was utilized as the flexible energy harvesting device. By combining them
with a rectifier, a stretchable, twistable, and bendable, self-charging
power package was achieved for sustainably driving wearable electronics.
This work provides a potential platform for the flexible self-powered
systems.},
