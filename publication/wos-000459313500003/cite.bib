 abstract = {Water wave energy is a promising renewable energy source that may
alleviate the rising concerns over current resource depletion, but it is
rarely exploited due to the lack of efficient energy harvesting
technologies. In this work, a hybrid system with a triboelectric
nanogenerator (TENG) and an electromagnetic generator (EMG) based on an
optimized inner topological structure is reported to effectively harvest
water wave energy. The TENG with etched polytetrafluoroethylene films
and Cu electrodes utilizing the contact-freestanding mode is designed
into a cubic structure, in which the EMG is well hybridized. An
integration of TENG and EMG achieves mutual compensation of their own
merits, enabling the hybrid system to deliver satisfactory output over a
broad range of operation frequency. The output performance of TENG with
varied inner topological structures is experimentally and theoretically
compared, and a concept is proposed to further clarify the energy
conversion efficiency, which should be considered in designing energy
harvesting devices. The influences of oscillation frequency, amplitude,
and dielectric materials on the output performance of the hybrid system
are comprehensively studied on different platforms. Furthermore, the
optimum operation frequency ranges for TENG and EMG are concluded. The
proposed hybrid nanogenerator renders an effective approach toward
large-scale blue energy harvesting over a broad frequency range.},
