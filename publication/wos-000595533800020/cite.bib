 abstract = {Developing low-cost and biodegradable piezoelectric nanogenerators is of
great importance for a variety of applications, from harvesting
low-grade mechanical energy to wearable sensors. Many of the most widely
used piezoelectric materials, including lead zirconate titanate (PZT),
suffer from serious drawbacks such as complicated synthesis, poor
mechanical properties (e.g., brittleness), and toxic composition,
limiting their development for biomedical applications and posing
environmental problems for their disposal. Here, we report a low-cost,
biodegradable, biocompatible, and highly compressible piezoelectric
nanogenerator based on a wood sponge obtained with a simple
delignification process. Thanks to the enhanced compressibility of the
wood sponge, our wood nanogenerator (15 x 15 x 14 mm(3), longitudinal x
radial x tangential) can generate an output voltage of up to 0.69 V, 85
times higher than that generated by native (untreated) wood, and it
shows stable performance under repeated cyclic compression (>= 600
cycles). Our approach suggests the importance of increased
compressibility of bulk materials for improving their piezoelectric
output. We demonstrate the versatility of our nanogenerator by showing
its application both as a wearable movement monitoring system (made with
a single wood sponge) and as a large-scale prototype with increased
output (made with 30 wood sponges) able to power simple electronic
devices (a LED light, a LCD screen). Moreover, we demonstrate the
biodegradability of our wood sponge piezoelectric nanogenerator by
studying its decomposition with cellulose-degrading fungi. Our results
showcase the potential application of a wood sponge as a sustainable
energy source, as a wearable device for monitoring human motions, and
its contribution to environmental sustainability by electronic waste
reduction.},
