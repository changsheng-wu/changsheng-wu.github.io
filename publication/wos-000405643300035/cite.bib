 abstract = {An integrated self-charging power unit, combining a hybrid silicon
nanowire/polymer heterojunction solar cell with a polypyrrole-based
supercapacitor, has been demonstrated to simultaneously harvest solar
energy and store it. By efficiency enhancement of the hybrid nanowire
solar cells and a dual-functional titanium film serving as conjunct
electrode of the solar cell and supercapacitor, the integrated system is
able to yield a total photoelectric conversion to storage efficiency of
10.5%, which is the record value in all the integrated solar energy
conversion and storage system. This system may not only serve as a
buffer that diminishes the solar power fluctuations from light
intensity, but also pave its way toward cost-effective high efficiency
self-charging power unit. Finally, an integrated device based on
ultrathin Si substrate is demonstrated to expand its feasibility and
potential application in flexible energy conversion and storage devices.},
