 abstract = {With the advances of artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous robotics,
virtual reality (VR) and Internet of things (IoT), an intelligent and
ubiquitous human-machine interfacing (HMI) ecosystem has become a desire
and attracted lots of interests. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG), as
a natural and effective mechanical-to-electrical signal conversion
technology, have been successfully utilized to realize many types of
HMI, including smart keyboards, body motion sensors, the electronic
skin, voice sensors, the triboelectrification-induced
electroluminescence, and the artificial muscle. Meanwhile, tribotronics,
as the coupling field of TENG and semiconductors, has demonstrated the
feasibility for tactile switch or sensing with the possibilities of high
integration and large scale. The fundamental theory of TENG and
tribotronics is revisited herein. In addition, the definition of HMI
and, for the first time, the research progress of the TENG and
tribotronics enabled HMI are systematically and thoroughly reviewed.
Finally, the perspectives in this emerging field are also discussed.},
