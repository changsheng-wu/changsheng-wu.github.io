 abstract = {It is known that contact-electrification (or triboelectrification)
usually occurs between two different materials, which could be explained
by several models for different materials systems (Adv. Mater. 2018, 30,
1706790; Adv. Mater. 2018, 30, 1803968). But contact between two pieces
of the chemically same material could also result in electrostatic
charges, although the charge density is rather low, which is hard to
understand from a physics point of view. In this paper, by preparing a
contact-separation mode triboelectric nanogenerator using two pieces of
an identical material, the direction of charge transfer during
contact-electrification is studied regarding its dependence on
curvatures of the sample surfaces. For materials such as
polytetrafluoroethylene, fluorinated ethylene propylene, Kapton,
polyester, and nylon, the positive curvature surfaces are net negatively
charged, while the negative curvature surfaces tend to be net positively
charged. Further verification of the above-mentioned trends was obtained
under vacuum (similar to 1 Pa) and higher temperature (<= 358 K)
conditions. Based on the received data acquired for gentle contacting
cases, we propose a curvature-dependent charge transfer model by
introducing curvature-induced energy shifts of the surface states.
However, this model is subject to be revised if the mutual contact mode
turns into a sliding mode or more complicated hard-pressed contact mode,
in which a rigorous contact between the two pieces of the same material
could result in nanoscale damage/fracture and possible species transfer.
Our study provides a primitive step toward understanding the basics of
contact-electrification.},
