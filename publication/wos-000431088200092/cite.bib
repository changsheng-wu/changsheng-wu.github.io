 abstract = {The development of the Internet of Things has brought new challenges to
the corresponding distributed sensor systems. Self-powered sensors that
can perceive and respond to environmental stimuli without an external
power supply are highly desirable. In this paper, a self-powered wind
sensor system based on an anemometer triboelectric nanogenerator
(a-TENG, free-standing mode) and a wind vane triboelectric nanogenerator
(v-TENG, single-electrode mode) is proposed for simultaneously detecting
wind speed and direction. A soft friction mode is adopted instead of a
typical rigid friction for largely enhancing the output performance of
the TENG. The design parameters including size, unit central angle, and
applied materials are optimized to enhance sensitivity, resolution, and
wide measurement scale. The optimized a-TENG could deliver an
open-circuit voltage of 88 V and short-circuit current of 6.3 mu A,
corresponding to a maximum power output of 0.47 mW (wind speed of 6.0
m/s), which is capable of driving electronics for data transmission and
storage. The current peak value of the a-TENG signal is used for
analyzing wind speed for less energy consumption. Moreover, the output
characteristics of a v-TENG are further explored, with six actual
operation situations, and the v-TENG delivers fast response to the
incoming wind and accurately outputs the wind direction data. As a wind
sensor system, wind speed ranging from 2.7 to 8.0 m/s can be well
detected (consistent with a commercial sensor) and eight regular
directions can be monitored. Therefore, the fabricated wind sensor
system has great potential in wireless environmental monitoring
applications.},
