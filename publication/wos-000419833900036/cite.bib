 abstract = {Owing to the compatibility with the traditional integrated circuit
technology, it is of great significance to enhance the photoresponse
performance of Silicon (Si)-based photodetectors (PDs) in the
near-infrared (NIR) wavelength. Here, by introducing the
piezo-phototronic effect, the photoresponsivity and the specific
detectivity of the p-Si/n-CdS heterojunction NIR PD are enhanced by 966
times and two orders of magnitude with a 1064 nm illumination of 0.35 mW
cm(-2) power density under -0.50% compressive strain, which is even
better than those of commercial Si PDs. The piezo-phototronic effect is
a three-way coupling effect of piezoelectricity, semiconductor and
optical excitation in piezoelectric semiconductors, such as wurtzite
structured CdS. Alternatively, the performance enhancement of the
n-Si/n-CdS heterojunction PD by the piezo-phototronic effect is much
less than that of the p-n heterojunction PD under the same compressive
straining conditions, due to their different energy band structures near
the Si/CdS heterojunction. This work provides not only a facile
solution-processed fabrication for high-performance Si-based NIR PDs,
but also a deep understanding about the piezophototronic effect on the
performance enhancement of Si/CdS heterojunction NIR PDs.},
