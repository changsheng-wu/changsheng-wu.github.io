 abstract = {Efficient ionization is a necessary condition for mass spectrometric
analysis, but many compounds fail to ionize well enough to yield
sufficient detection limits. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) coupled
to nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESl) mass spectrometry (MS) are a
highly effective approach to high sensitivity MS analysis. Here, we
report on new, large-area TENG that constructively leverage the
relationship between electrode size, created charges, and open-circuit
voltage, leading to wider chemical coverage. Large-area TENG were found
to also promote electrospray gas-phase oxidation reactions that enabled
double bond position pinpointing for unsaturated lipids and
species-specific lipid quantitation. Furthermore, large-area TENG MS of
proteins was observed to yield higher charge state distributions (i.e.,
supercharging) without the need for high surface tension additives.},
