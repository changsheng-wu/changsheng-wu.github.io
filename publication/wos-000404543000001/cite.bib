 abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study aimed to develop a procedure simulation platform
for in vitro transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using
patient-specific 3-dimensional (3D) printed tissue-mimicking phantoms.
We investigated the feasibility of using these 3D printed phantoms to
quantitatively predict the occurrence, severity, and location of any
degree of post-TAVR paravalvular leaks (PVL).
BACKGROUND We have previously shown that metamaterial 3D printing
technique can be used to create patient-specific phantoms that mimic the
mechanical properties of biological tissue. This may have applications
in procedural planning for cardiovascular interventions.
METHODS This retrospective study looked at 18 patients who underwent
TAVR. Patient-specific aortic root phantoms were created using the
tissue-mimicking 3D printing technique using pre-TAVR computed
tomography. The CoreValve (self-expanding valve) prostheses were
deployed in the phantoms to simulate the TAVR procedure, from which
post-TAVR aortic root strain was quantified in vitro. A novel index, the
annular bulge index, was measured to assess the post-TAVR annular strain
unevenness in the phantoms. We tested the comparative predictive value
of the bulge index and other known predictors of post-TAVR PVL.
RESULTS The maximum annular bulge index was significantly different
among patient subgroups that had no PVL, trace-to-mild PVL, and
moderate-to-severe PVL (p - 0.001). Compared with other known PVL
predictors, bulge index was the only significant predictor of
moderate-severe PVL (area under the curve = 95%; p < 0.0001). Also, in
12 patients with post-TAVR PVL, the annular bulge index predicted the
major PVL location in 9 patients (accuracy = 75%).
CONCLUSIONS In this proof-of-concept study, we have demonstrated the
feasibility of using 3D printed tissue-mimicking phantoms to
quantitatively assess the post-TAVR aortic root strain in vitro. A novel
indicator of the post-TAVR annular strain unevenness, the annular bulge
index, outperformed the other established variables and achieved a high
level of accuracy in predicting post-TAVR PVL, in terms of its
occurrence, severity, and location. (C) 2017 by the American College of
