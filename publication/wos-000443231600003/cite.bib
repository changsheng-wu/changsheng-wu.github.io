 abstract = {The auditory system is the most efficient and straightforward
communication strategy for connecting human beings and robots. Here, we
designed a self-powered triboelectric auditory sensor (TAS) for
constructing an electronic auditory system and an architecture for an
external hearing aid in intelligent robotic applications. Based on newly
developed triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology, the TAS showed
ultrahigh sensitivity (110 millivolts/decibel). A TAS with the broadband
response from 100 to 5000 hertz was achieved by designing the annular or
sectorial inner boundary architecture with systematic optimization. When
incorporated with intelligent robotic devices, TAS demon-strated
high-quality music recording and accurate voice recognition for
realizing intelligent human-robot interaction. Furthermore, the tunable
resonant frequency of TAS was achieved by adjusting the geometric design
of inner bound-ary architecture, which could be used to amplify a
specific sound wave naturally. On the basis of this unique property, we
propose a hearing aid with the TENG technique, which can simplify the
signal processing circuit and reduce the power consuming. This work
expresses notable advantages of using TENG technology to build a new
generation of auditory systems for meeting the challenges in social
robotics.},
