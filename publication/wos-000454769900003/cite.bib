 abstract = {As the world is marching into the era of the internet of things (IoTs)
and artificial intelligence, the most vital development for hardware is
a multifunctional array of sensing systems, which forms the foundation
of the fourth industrial revolution toward an intelligent world. Given
the need for mobility of these multitudes of sensors, the success of the
IoTs calls for distributed energy sources, which can be provided by
solar, thermal, wind, and mechanical triggering/vibrations. The
triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for mechanical energy harvesting
developed by Z.L. Wang's group is one of the best choices for this
energy for the new era, since triboelectrification is a universal and
ubiquitous effect with an abundant choice of materials. The development
of self-powered active sensors enabled by TENGs is revolutionary
compared to externally powered passive sensors, similar to the advance
from wired to wireless communication. In this paper, the fundamental
theory, experiments, and applications of TENGs are reviewed as a
foundation of the energy for the new era with four major application
fields: micro/nano power sources, self-powered sensors, large-scale blue
energy, and direct high-voltage power sources. A roadmap is proposed for
the research and commercialization of TENG in the next 10 years.},
