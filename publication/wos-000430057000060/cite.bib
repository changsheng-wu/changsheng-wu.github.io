 abstract = {The ubiquitous sensors have accelerated the realization of Internet of
Things (IoT) but also raised challenges to the current overcrowding
radio frequency (RF) based communications. The optical wireless
communication (OWC) that utilizes the wide optic bandwidth can well
solve the spectrum crisis and is an appealing complementary solution to
the IoT applications. However, the additional direct current (DC) power
supply and complicated modulating and power management circuits may
limit the large-scale deployment of OWC systems. In this paper, by
integrating with triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), the
light-emitting diode (LED) could be directly transformed into a wireless
transmitter that conveys the information associated with mechanical
stimuli without additional power supply. With the customized TENG
devices and the help of advanced image processing and machine learning
techniques, three demonstrations with functions of optical remote
control, pressure sensing, and security authentication, were
demonstrated. The concept and results in this paper may greatly broaden
the application of IoT through the integration of OWC and TENG.},
