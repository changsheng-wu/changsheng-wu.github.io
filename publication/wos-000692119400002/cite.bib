 abstract = {Wood is a state-of-art, renewable, and sustainable building material
with excellent mechanical properties but negligible triboelectric
polarizability. Strategies to improve and rationally tune the
triboelectric properties of wood are needed to further its application
for mechanical energy harvesting in smart buildings. We found that wood
becomes more triboelectrically positive when modified by in situ-grown
zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), a metal-organic framework
(MOF), and more triboelectrically negative when coated with
poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) made
with two radial-cut wood samples (L x R x T: 35 x 20 x 1 mm(3)),
respectively functionalized with ZIF-8 and PDMS, can generate an
open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 24.3 V and a short-circuit current (Isc)
of 0.32 mu A upon 50 N, 80 times higher compared with that of native
wood. We demonstrate the applicability of our functionalized wood TENG
(FW-TENG) in smart buildings by using it to power household lamps,
calculators, and electrochromic windows.},
