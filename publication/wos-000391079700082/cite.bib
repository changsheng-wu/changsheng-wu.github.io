 abstract = {Ocean energy, in theory, is an enormous clean and renewable energy
resource that can generate electric power much more than that required
to power the entire globe without adding any pollution to the
atmosphere. However, owing to a lack of effective technology, such blue
energy is almost unexplored to meet the energy requirement of human
society. In this work, a fully packaged hybrid nanogenerator consisting
of a rolling triboelectric nanogenerator (R-TENG) and an electromagnetic
generator (EMG) is developed to harvest water motion energy. The
outstanding output performance of the R-TENG (45 cm(3) in volume and
28.3 g in weight) in the low-frequency range (<1.8 Hz) complements the
ineffective output of EMG (337 cm(3) in volume and 311.8 g in weight) in
the same range and thus enables the hybrid nanogenerator to deliver
valuable outputs in a broad range of operation frequencies. Therefore,
the hybrid nanogenerator can maximize the energy conversion efficiency
and broaden the operating frequency simultaneously. In terms of charging
capacitors, this hybrid nanogenerator provides not only high voltage and
consistent charging from the TENG component but also fast charging speed
from the EMG component. The practical application of the hybrid
nanogenerator is also demonstrated to power light-emitting diodes by
harvesting energy from stimulated tidal flow. The high robustness of the
R-TENG is also validated based on the stable electrical output after
continuous rolling motion. Therefore, the hybrid R-TENG and EMG device
renders an effective and sustainable approach toward large-scale blue
energy harvesting in a broad frequency range.},
