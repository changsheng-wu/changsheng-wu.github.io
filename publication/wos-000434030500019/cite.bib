 abstract = {Field emission of electrons usually requires high voltage (HV) of at
least 100 V, which limits its applications due to the high cost,
instability, portability issues, etc., of the HV instrument.
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been developed to provide an
HV of at least several kV for portable/mobile instrument, with
controllability already demonstrated. Here, the field emission of
electrons driven by TENG, namely, tribo-field emission, is presented for
the first time. The emission voltage and the charge transfer per cycle
can be tuned and controlled by TENG. The current peak generated from
TENG with limited charge transfer is demonstrated to be more favorable
than the direct current HV source in terms of emitter protection. A
unidirectional continuous emission current is achieved through the
tribo-field emission. A cathode-ray tube can be powered by TENG, with
hours of illumination demonstrated through only one sliding motion. Such
approach can provide a potential solution for controllable, stable, and
portable field-emission devices without any additional external power
sources.},
