 abstract = {Cadmium sulfide (CdS) has received widespread attention as the building
block of optoelectronic devices due to its extraordinary optoelectronic
properties, low work function, and excellent thermal and chemical
stability. Here, a self-powered flexible photodetector (PD) based on
p-Si/n-CdS nanowires heterostructure is fabricated. By introducing the
pyro-phototronic effect derived from wurtzite structured CdS, the
self-powered PD shows a broadband response range, even beyond the
bandgap limitation, from UV (325 nm) to near infrared (1550 nm) under
zero bias with fast response speed. The light-induced pyroelectric
potential is utilized to modulate the optoelectronic processes and thus
improve the photoresponse performance. Lasers with different wavelengths
have different effects on the self-powered PDs and corresponding working
mechanisms are carefully investigated. Upon 325 nm laser illumination,
the rise time and fall time of the self-powered PD are 245 and 277 mu s,
respectively, which are faster than those of most previously reported
CdS-based nanostructure PDs. Meanwhile, the photoresponsivity R and
specific detectivity D* regarding to the relative peak-to-peak current
are both enhanced by 67.8 times, compared with those only based on the
photovoltaic effect-induced photocurrent. The self-powered flexible PD
with fast speed, stable, and broadband response is expected to have
extensive applications in various environments.},
