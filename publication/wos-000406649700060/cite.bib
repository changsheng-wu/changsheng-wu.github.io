 abstract = {Although silicon (Si) devices are the backbone of modern
(opto-)electronics, infrared Si-photosensing suffers from low-efficiency
due to its limitation in light-absorption. Here, we demonstrate a large
improvement in the performance, equivalent to a 366-fold enhancement in
photoresponsivity, of a Si-based near-infrared (NIR) photodetector (PD)
by introducing the piezo-phototronic effect via a deposited CdS layer.
By externally applying a -0.15 parts per thousand compressive strain to
the heterojunction, carrier-dynamics modulation at the local junction
can be induced by the piezoelectric polarization, and the
photoresponsivity and detectivity of the PD exhibit an enhancement of
two orders of magnitude, with the peak values up to 19.4 A/W and 1.8 X
10(12) cm Hz(1/2)/W, respectively. The obtained maximum responsivity is
considerably larger than those of commercial Si and InGaAs PDs in the MR
waveband. Meanwhile, the rise time and fall time are reduced by 84.6%
and 76.1% under the external compressive strain. This work provides a
cost-effective approach to achieve high-performance NIR photosensing by
the piezo-phototronic effect for high-integration Si-based
optoelectronic systems.},
