Abstract = {{Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) systems with feedback control have
   attracted extensive research and clinical interest owing to their unique
   advantages of convenience, self-administration, and safety. Here, a
   self-powered wearable iontophoretic TDD system that can be driven and
   regulated by the energy harvested from biomechanical motions is proposed
   for closed-loop motion detection and therapy. A wearable triboelectric
   nanogenerator (TENG) is used as the motion sensor and energy harvester
   that can convert biomechanical motions into electricity for
   iontophoresis without stored-energy power sources, while a
   hydrogel-based soft patch with side-by-side electrodes is designed to
   enable noninvasive iontophoretic TDD. Proof-of-concept experiments on
   pig skin with dyes as model drugs successfully demonstrate the
   feasibility of the proposed system. This work not only extends the
   application of TENG in the biomedical field, but may also provide a
   cost-effective solution for noninvasive, electrically assisted TDD with
   closed-loop sensing and treatment.}},
