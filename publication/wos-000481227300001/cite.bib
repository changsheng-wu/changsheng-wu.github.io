Abstract = {{A liquid-solid contact triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on
   poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) film, a copper electrode, and a glass
   substrate for harvesting energy in oil/water multiphases is reported.
   There are two distinctive signals being generated, one is from the
   contact electrification and electrostatic induction between the liquid
   (water/oil) and the PTFE film (V-TENG and I-TENG); and the other is from
   the electrostatic induction in the copper electrode by the oil/water
   interfacial charges (Delta V-interface and I-interface), which is
   generated only when the liquid-solid contact TENG is inserted across the
   oil/water interface. The two signals show interesting opposite changing
   trends that the V-TENG and I-TENG decrease while the oil/water
   interfacial signals of Delta V-interface and I-interface increase after
   coating a layer of polydopamine on the surfaces of PTFE and glass via
   self-polymerization. As an application of the observed phenomena, both
   the values of I-TENG and I-interface have a good linear relationship
   versus the natural logarithm of the concentration of the dopamine. Based
   on this, the first self-powered dual-signal detection of dopamine using
   TENG is demonstrated.}},
