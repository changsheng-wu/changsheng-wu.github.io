Abstract = {{Wireless, skin-integrated devices for continuous, clinical-quality
   monitoring of vital signs have the potential to greatly improve the care
   of patients in neonatal and pediatric intensive-care units. These same
   technologies can also be used in the home, across a broad spectrum of
   ages, from beginning to end of life. Although miniaturized forms of such
   devices minimize patient burden and improve compliance, they represent
   life-threatening choking hazards for infants. A materials strategy is
   presented here to address this concern. Specifically, composite
   materials are introduced as soft encapsulating layers and gentle
   adhesives that release chemical compounds designed to elicit an intense
   bitter taste when placed in the mouth. Reflexive reactions to this
   sensation strongly reduce the potential for ingestion, as a safety
   feature. The materials systems described involve a non-toxic bitterant
   (denatonium benzoate) as a dopant in an elastomeric
   (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) or hydrogel matrix. Experimental and
   computational studies of these composite materials and the kinetics of
   release of the bitterant define the key properties. Incorporation into
   various wireless skin-integrated sensors demonstrates their utility in
   functional systems. This simple strategy offers valuable protective
   capabilities, with broad practical relevance to the welfare of children
   monitored with wearable devices.}},
