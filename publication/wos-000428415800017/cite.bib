 abstract = {Technologies for energy harvesting from objects in motion are gaining a
continuously increasing interest to directly power wearable electronics,
sensors, and wireless transmitters. New networks where things will be
uniquely identified and interconnected will require key enabling
technologies, particularly cheap, flexible generators of renewable
energy, conformable to any solid surface, to power independently
individual objects and data transmission. Polymer-based nanogenerators
(PNGs), capable of converting mechanical energy into electricity, have
exact features to fulfill these requirements. This article highlights
advances in PNGs with focus on material chemistries and geometrical
features, device design strategies, and performances. Representative
examples of applications which show large-scale capability are reported.
Concluding sections summarize the key challenges and the
commercialization perspectives of PNGs for use in real life
applications. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
