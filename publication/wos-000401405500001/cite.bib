 abstract = {Ferroelectret nanogenerators were recently introduced as a promising
alternative technology for harvesting kinetic energy. Here we report the
device's intrinsic properties that allow for the bidirectional
conversion of energy between electrical and mechanical domains; thus
extending its potential use in wearable electronics beyond the power
generation realm. This electromechanical coupling, combined with their
flexibility and thin film-like form, bestows dual-functional transducing
capabilities to the device that are used in this work to demonstrate its
use as a thin, wearable and self-powered loudspeaker or microphone
patch. To determine the device's performance and applicability, sound
pressure level is characterized in both space and frequency domains for
three different configurations. The confirmed device's high performance
is further validated through its integration in three different systems:
a music-playing flag, a sound recording film and a flexible microphone
for security applications.},
