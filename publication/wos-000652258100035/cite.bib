 abstract = {Soft, skin-integrated electronic sensors can provide continuous
measurements of diverse physiological parameters, with broad relevance
to the future of human health care. Motion artifacts can, however,
corrupt the recorded signals, particularly those associated with
mechanical signatures of cardiopulmonary processes. Design strategies
introduced here address this limitation through differential operation
of a matched, time-synchronized pair of high-bandwidth accelerometers
located on parts of the anatomy that exhibit strong spatial gradients in
motion characteristics. When mounted at a location that spans the
suprasternal notch and the sternal manubrium, these dual-sensing devices
allow measurements of heart rate and sounds, respiratory activities,
body temperature, body orientation, and activity level, along with
swallowing, coughing, talking, and related processes, without
sensitivity to ambient conditions during routine daily activities,
vigorous exercises, intense manual labor, and even swimming. Deployments
on patients with COVID-19 allow clinical-grade ambulatory monitoring of
the key symptoms of the disease even during rehabilitation protocols.},
