 abstract = {Microfluidic technologies have wide-ranging applications in chemical
analysis systems, drug delivery platforms, and artificial vascular
networks. This latter area is particularly relevant to 3D cell cultures,
engineered tissues, and artificial organs, where volumetric capabilities
in fluid distribution are essential. Existing schemes for fabricating 3D
microfluidic structures are constrained in realizing desired layout
designs, producing physiologically relevant microvascular structures,
and/or integrating active
electronic/optoelectronic/microelectromechanical components for sensing
and actuation. This paper presents a guided assembly approach that
bypasses these limitations to yield complex 3D microvascular structures
from 2D precursors that exploit the full sophistication of 2D
fabrication methods. The capabilities extend to feature sizes <5 mu m,
in extended arrays and with various embedded sensors and actuators,
across wide ranges of overall dimensions, in a parallel, high-throughput
process. Examples include 3D microvascular networks with sophisticated
layouts, deterministically designed and constructed to expand the
geometries and operating features of artificial vascular networks.},
