 abstract = {With the fast development of the Internet of Things, the requirements of
system miniaturization and integration have accelerated research on
multifunctional sensors. Based on the triboelectric nanogenerator, a
self-powered multifunctional motion sensor (MFMS) is proposed in this
work, which is capable of detecting the motion parameters, including
direction, speed, and acceleration of linear and rotary motions,
simultaneously. The MFMS consists of a triboelectric nanogenerator
(TENG) module, a magnetic regulation module, and an acrylic shell. The
TENG module is formed by placing a free-standing magnetic disk (MD) on a
polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) plate with six copper electrodes. The
movement of the MFMS causes the MD to slide on the PTFE plate and hence
excites the electrodes to produce a voltage output. The carefully
designed six copper electrodes (an inner circle electrode, an outer
circle electrode, and four arc electrodes between them) can distinguish
eight directions of movement with the acceleration and determine the
rotational speed and direction as well. Besides, the magnetic regulation
module is applied here by fixing a magnetic cylinder (MC) in the shell,
right under the center of the PTFE plate. Due to the magnetic attraction
applied by the MC, the MD will automatically return to the center to
prepare for the next round of detection, which makes the proposed sensor
much more applicable in practice.},
