 abstract = {Over the last decade, bioprinting has emerged as a promising technology
in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. With
recent advances in additive manufacturing, bioprinting is poised to
provide patient-specific therapies and new approaches for tissue and
organ studies, drug discoveries and even food manufacturing.
Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) is a method that has been applied to
assess manufacturing maturity and to identify risks and gaps in
technology-manufacturing transitions. Technology Readiness Level (TRL)
is used to evaluate the maturity of a technology. This paper reviews
recent advances in bioprinting following the MRL scheme and addresses
corresponding MRL levels of engineering challenges and gaps associated
with the translation of bioprinting from lab-bench experiments to
ultimate full-scale manufacturing of tissues and organs. According to
our step-by-step TRL and MRL assessment, after years of rigorous
investigation by the biotechnology community, bioprinting is on the cusp
of entering the translational phase where laboratory research practices
can be scaled up into manufacturing products specifically designed for
individual patients.},
