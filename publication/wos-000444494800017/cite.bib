 abstract = {Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) naturally have the capability of
high voltage output to breakdown gas easily. Here we present a concept
of triboelectric microplasma by integrating TENGs with the plasma source
so that atmospheric-pressure plasma can be powered only by mechanical
stimuli. Four classical atmospheric-pressure microplasma sources are
successfully demonstrated, including dielectric barrier discharge (DBD),
atmospheric-pressure non-equilibrium plasma jets (APNP-J), corona
discharge, and microspark discharge. For these types of microplasma,
analysis of electric characteristics, optical emission spectra, COMSOL
simulation and equivalent circuit model are carried out to explain
transient process of different discharge. The triboelectric microplasma
has been applied to patterned luminescence and surface treatment
successfully as a first-step evaluation as well as to prove the system
feasibility. This work offers a promising, facile, portable and safe
supplement to traditional plasma sources, and will enrich the diversity
of plasma applications based on the reach of existing technologies.},
