 abstract = {The development of flexible and stretchable electronics has attracted
intensive attention for their promising applications in next-generation
wearable functional devices. However, these stretchable devices that are
made in a conventional planar format have largely hindered their
development, especially in highly stretchable conditions. Herein, a
novel type of highly stretchable, fiber-based triboelectric
nanogenerator (fiber-like TENG) for power generation is developed. Owing
to the advanced structural designs, including the fiber-convolving fiber
and the stretchable electrodes on elastic silicone rubber fiber, the
fiber-like TENG can be operated at stretching mode with high strains up
to 70% and is demonstrated for a broad range of applications such as
powering a commercial capacitor, LCD screen, digital watch/calculator,
and self-powered acceleration sensor. This work verifies the promising
potential of a novel fiber-based structure for both power generation and
self-powered sensing.},
