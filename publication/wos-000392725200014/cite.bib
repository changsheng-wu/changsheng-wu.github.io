 abstract = {Electric eel-skin-inspired mechanically durable and super-stretchable
nanogenerator is demonstrated for the first time by using triboelectric
effect. This newly designed nanogenerator can produce electricity by
touch or tapping despite under various extreme mechanical deformations
or even after experiencing damage. This device can be used not only as
deformable and wearable power source but also as fully autonomous and
self-sufficient adaptive electronic skin system.},
