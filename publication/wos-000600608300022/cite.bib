 abstract = {The standard of clinical care in many pediatric and neonatal
neurocritical care units involves continuous monitoring of cerebral
hemodynamics using hard-wired devices that physically adhere to the skin
and connect to base stations that commonly mount on an adjacent wall or
stand. Risks of iatrogenic skin injuries associated with adhesives that
bond such systems to the skin and entanglements of the patients and/or
the healthcare professionals with the wires can impede clinical
procedures and natural movements that are critical to the care,
development, and recovery of pediatric patients. This paper presents a
wireless, miniaturized, and mechanically soft, flexible device that
supports measurements quantitatively comparable to existing clinical
standards. The system features a multiphotodiode array and pair of
light-emitting diodes for simultaneous monitoring of systemic and
cerebral hemodynamics, with ability to measure cerebral oxygenation,
heart rate, peripheral oxygenation, and potentially cerebral pulse
pressure and vascular tone, through the utilization of multiwavelength
reflectance-mode photoplethysmography and functional near-infrared
spectroscopy. Monte Carlo optical simulations define the tissue-probing
depths for source-detector distances and operating wavelengths of these
systems using magnetic resonance images of the head of a representative
pediatric patient to define the relevant geometries. Clinical studies on
pediatric subjects with and without congenital central hypoventilation
syndrome validate the feasibility for using this system in operating
hospitals and define its advantages relative to established
technologies. This platformhas the potential to substantially enhance
the quality of pediatric care across a wide range of conditions and use
scenarios, not only in advanced hospital settings but also in clinics of
lower- and middle-income countries.},
