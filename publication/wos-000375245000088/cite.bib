 abstract = {The development of stretchable energy generation devices is
indispensable for achieving stretchable, self-powered electronic
systems. In this paper, a type of highly stretchable triboelectric
nanogenerators made from conventional, inelastic materials such as paper
is presented. It exploits a rationally designed interlocking kirigami
structure and is capable of harvesting energy from various types of
motions such as stretching, pressing, and twisting owing to the
shape-adaptive thin film design. Energy harvested from the as-fabricated
devices has been used for powering an LCD screen and lighting LED
arrays. Furthermore, the paper-based devices have also been demonstrated
for self-powered acceleration sensing and self-powered sensing of book
opening and closing. This work introduces traditional kirigami into the
development of stretchable triboelectric nanogenerators and verifies its
promising applications in both power generation and self-powered
sensing.},
