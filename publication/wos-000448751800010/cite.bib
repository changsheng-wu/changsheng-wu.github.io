 abstract = {We demonstrate the rapid, large-area transformation of bioenabled
graphene laminates into multidimensional geometries for pop-up and
stretchable applications. Water-vapor annealing facilitates the
controlled plasticization of the multilayered silk graphene
morphologies, allowing highly localized kirigami cuts by programmable
drag knife with diverse type and depth of cuts. By adjusting drag-knife
depth, we can generate a micro scale array of full and partial cuts,
enabling a purely topological approach toward the control of metastable
fold unfold states and crack fracture paths in kirigami structures.
Through orthogonal control over the graphene silk composite's nanoscale
morphology, cut pattern, and semimetal-like conductivity, we showcase
bioenabled laminates as a platform for prospective soft and
shape-transforming electronics as flexible interconnects and stretchable
energy harvesters.},
