Title = {{Intramuscular Near-Infrared Spectroscopy for Muscle Flap Monitoring in a
   Porcine Model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RECONSTRUCTIVE MICROSURGERY}},
Abstract = {{Background Current near-infrared spectroscopy (MRS)-based systems for
   continuous flap monitoring are limited to flaps which carry a cutaneous
   paddle. As such, this useful and reliable technology has not previously
   been applicable to muscle-only free flaps where other modalities with
   substantial limitations continue to be utilized.
   Methods We present the first MRS probe which allows continuous
   monitoring of local tissue oxygen saturation (StO(2)) directly within
   the substance of muscle tissue. This probe is flexible, subcentimeter in
   scale, waterproof, biocompatible, and is fitted with resorbable barbs
   which facilitate temporary autostabilization followed by easy atraumatic
   removal. This novel device was compared with a ViOptix T.Ox monitor in a
   porcine rectus abdominus myocutaneous flap model of arterial and venous
   occlusions. During these experiments, the T.Ox device was affixed to the
   skin paddle, while the novel probe was within the muscle component of
   the same flap.
   Results The intramuscular MRS device and skin-mounted ViOptix T.Ox
   devices produced very similar StO(2) tracings throughout the vascular
   clamping events, with obvious and parallel changes occurring upon
   vascular clamping and release. The normalized cross-correlation at zero
   lag describing correspondence between the novel intramuscular MRS and
   T.Ox devices was >0.99.
   Conclusion This novel intramuscular MRS probe offers continuous
   monitoring of oxygen saturation within muscle flaps. This experiment
   demonstrates the potential suitability of this intramuscular MRS probe
   for the task of muscle-only free flap monitoring, where MRS has not
   previously been applicable. Testing in the clinical environment is
   necessary to assess durability and reliability.}},
