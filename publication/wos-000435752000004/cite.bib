 abstract = {Patient-specific tissue-mimicking phantoms have a wide range of
biomedical applications including validation of computational models and
imaging techniques, medical device testing, surgery planning, medical
education, doctor-patient interaction, etc. Although 3D printing
technologies have demonstrated great potential in fabricating
patient-specific phantoms, current 3D printed phantoms are usually only
geometrically accurate. Mechanical properties of soft tissues can merely
be mimicked at small strain situations, such as ultrasonic induced
vibration. Under large deformation, the soft tissues and the 3D printed
phantoms behave differently. The essential barrier is the inherent
difference in the stress-strain curves of soft tissues and 3D printable
polymers. This study investigated the feasibility of mimicking the
strain-stiffening behavior of soft tissues using dual-material 3D
printed metamaterials with micro-structured reinforcement embedded in
soft polymeric matrix. Three types of metamaterials were designed and
tested: sinusoidal wave, double helix, and interlocking chains. Even
though the two base materials were strain-softening polymers, both
finite element analysis and uniaxial tension tests indicated that two of
those dual-material designs were able to exhibit strain-stiffening
effects as a metamaterial. The effects of the design parameters on the
mechanical behavior of the metamaterials were also demonstrated. The
results suggested that the fabrication of patient-specific
tissue-mimicking phantoms with both geometrical and mechanical
accuracies is possible with dual-material 3D printed metamaterials.
