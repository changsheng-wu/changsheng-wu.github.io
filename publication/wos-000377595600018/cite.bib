 abstract = {Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) are able to convert mechanical
energy into electricity. In this work, a self-powered electrochemical
synthesis circle is designed, in which the electrode material of the
TENG, polypyrrole (PPy), is prepared by the pulse output of the
PPy-based TENG itself. The TENG based on PPy from self-powered synthesis
(SPSPPy) presents a competitive performance compared to those made from
commercial pulse sources. A supercapacitor that is fabricated from
SPSPPy has a far superior performance than that synthesized by the
conventional galvanostatic method. Furthermore, a self-charging power
system that integrates a TENG and a supercapacitor is demonstrated to
drive an electronic device sustainably. Moreover, the polymerization
efficiency is optimized in TENG-based electrochemical synthesis because
its high voltage can sustain multiple reactors simultaneously. Its upper
limit is theoretically analyzed for optimal energy utility, and a
maximum number of 39 reactors can be powered experimentally. Hence, TENG
is validated as an effective pulse generator for the synthesis of PPy as
well as other electrochemical technology, and this work greatly improves
the understandings of TENG-based self-powered electrochemical systems.},
