 abstract = {Recent progress in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) has demonstrated
their promising potential as a high-efficiency mechanical energy
harvesting technology, and plenty of effort has been devoted to
improving the power output by maximizing the triboelectric surface
charge density. However, due to high-voltage air breakdown, most of the
enhanced surface charge density brought by material/surface optimization
or external ion injection is not retainable or usable for electricity
generation during the operation of contact-separation-triggered TENGs.
Here, the existence of the air breakdown effect in a contact-separation
mode TENG with a low threshold surface charge density of approximate to
40-50 mu C m(-2) is first validated under the high impedance external
load, and then followed by the theoretical study of the maximized
effective energy output as limited by air breakdown for
contact-separation-triggered TENGs. The effects of air pressure and gas
composition are also studied and propose promising solutions for
reducing the air breakdown effect. This research provides a crucial
fundamental study for TENG technology and its further development and
applications.},
