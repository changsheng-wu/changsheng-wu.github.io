 abstract = {Integrating direct-write (DW) devices into three-dimensional (3D)
printed parts is key to continuing innovation in engineering
applications such as smart material systems and structural health
monitoring. However, this integration is challenging because: (1) most
3D printing techniques leave rough or porous surfaces if they are
untreated; (2) the thermal sintering process required for most
conductive inks could degrade the polymeric materials of 3D printed
parts; and (3) the extensive pause needed for the DW process during
layer-by-layer fabrication may cause weaker interlayer bonding and
create structural weak points. These challenges are rather common during
the insertion of conductive patterns inside 3D printed structures. As an
avoidance tactic, we developed a simple `print-stick-peel' method to
transfer the DW device from the polytetrafluoroethylene or
perfluoroalkoxy alkanes film onto any layer of a 3D printed object. This
transfer can be achieved using the self-adhesion of 3D printing
materials or applying additional adhesive. We demonstrated this method
by transferring Aerosol Jet (R) printed strain sensors into parts
fabricated by PolyJet (TM) printing. This report provides an
investigation and discussion on the sensitivity, reliability, and
influence embedding the sensor has on mechanical properties.},
